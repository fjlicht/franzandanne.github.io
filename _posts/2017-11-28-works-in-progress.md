Some potatoes from the 2017 cultivar pathology field trial harvest I completed this October. I tested 6 varieties of potato against two different fungal pathogens, *Helminthosporium solani* and *Colletotrichum coccodes* which are both economically important to potato growers in the San Luis Valley.

Purple variety after field-scale soil-borne pathogen innoculations!

Early season field trip around the valley with growers and CSU professors.
