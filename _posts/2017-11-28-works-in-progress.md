Some potatoes from the 2017 cultivar pathology field trial harvest I completed this October. I tested 6 varieties of potato against two different fungal pathogens, *Helminthosporium solani* and *Colletotrichum coccodes* which are both of economical interest to potato growers in the San Luis Valley.
