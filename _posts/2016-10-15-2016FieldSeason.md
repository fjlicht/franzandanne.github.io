Research during the 2016 field season in the San Luis valley of southern Colorado was both amazing and challenging. Conditions for growing potatoes and barley are varied and one of the main challenges is getting the seed in the ground early enough but not too early!

Cutting seed at the SLVRC was taking months to do by hand, hopefully the new automatic seed cutter will reduce this time!
