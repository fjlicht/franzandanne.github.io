			<h1>About</h1>
      <p>I have studied a mix of biology: ecological, computational, and pathological which provides me with a unique perspective in my current research.<br> 
	      <br>An alumnus of Pennsylvania State University, I have explored numerous research fields, from mycorrhizal fungi and bacterial pathogens of cucurbits with <a href=https://www.huck.psu.edu/content/research>multiple mentors at Penn State</a> to human pathology at <a href=http://www.wrair.army.mil>the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research</a>.<br>
	      <br>I worked on agricultural plant pathogens, particularily fungal pathogens of potato and inter species interactions.<br> 
	      
	      
	      <br>I began my graduate studies at the <a href=https://extension.unh.edu/Agriculture/Field-and-Forage-Crops>the University of New Hampshire</a>,
	      where I focused on soil microbial community dynamics associated with perennial grass systems in the northeastern US.<br> 
	      <br>Here I recieved an opportunity to research abroad in Senegal, Western Africa for a National Science Foundation fellowship to study soil microbial ecology, partnering with US, French,<a href=http://www.umr-ecosols.fr/en/recherche> and Senegalese Researchers</a>.<br> 
	      
	      <br>The Broders lab then moved west to CSU and I followed to continue my research and PhD.<br> 

	     <br>Completing my PhD in Plant Pathology in Fort Collins, Colorado and having enjoyed the beautiful weather and gorgeous skies for three years.<br> 
	      <br>I decided to move back east, completing a year long post doc experience at the USDA-ARS Food Quality lab under the guidance of Dr. Wayne Jurick, an awesome mentor and scientist. I have now moved on to study more basic fungal biology at Dartmouth College under Dr. Jay Dunlap.<br>
	     <br>With my personal time I get outside, work on my current research interests and evolving recreational activities.</p>
